 ## Usage
 To use aperture.css in your website, simply drop the stylesheet into your document's `<head>`, and add the class `apertured` to an element with a background image, along with any of the animation names. That's it! You've got a CSS animated loop video effect. Kool Beans!


 You can build video animations from aperture.css when you combine it with jQuery or add your own CSS rules. Dynamically add video animations using jQuery with ease:

 ## Contributing
 Pull requests are the way to go here. I apologise in advance for the slow action on pull requests and issues. I only have two rules for submitting a pull request: match the naming convention (camelCase, categorised [fades, bounces, etc]) and let us see a demo of submitted animations in a [pen](http://codepen.io). That last one is important.

 Graciasly copied from animate.css git repo, Thanks.
